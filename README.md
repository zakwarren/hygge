# Hygge

Hygge is the Danish and Norwegian word for the feeling of being nice,
cozy, and happy. Normally it's associated with being at home and
together with loved ones.

Now you can take a small part of that feeling with you wherever you go
with this app. Embrace the coziness and contentment.

## App

This has been built as a Progressive Web App (PWA) so, if you're using a
modern browser, you can install it as a standalone app. It's designed
with mobile devices in mind, so looks best on smaller screen.
